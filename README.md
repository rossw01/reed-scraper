# ReedScraper

The idea for this project came up while frustrated that no popular job listing sites had the ability to prevent results containing certain keywords from appearing.
The program in it's current state takes a preset list of words and searches for them in the job listings' descriptions, then returns only the jobs which do *not* contain said words in their descriptions to a test file named 'Output.txt'.

### TODO
* Needs multipage support implementing.
* Needs major code revisions to improve scalability/readability.
* Additional user controls to control queries.
